# This project is making it to where the customer can search for an item and there is a couple ways it outputs.
# The code for grabbing and outputting i think i did a really good job in.
# things i could work on is having the customer to press a button to print a diffrent output slide.
# I found outputting the astericks the hardest part cause it needed to be a certain number of the product.
# Being able to correctly grab the info from another file into where I need it, is something that will be exetremly helpful for future projects
# Made sure to make inline comments and tried to make the code as clean as possible.
